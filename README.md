## Description:
In the game, blocks of either red or blue colour will fall from the top of the screen. The player must move his basket to collect the falling blocks. He must also change the colour of his basket to match the colour of the falling block to score a point. For each consecutive score, he adds 1 to his combo multiplier, up to a maximum of 3. This multiplies the points added to his score for each successful catch. As the game progresses, the speed of the falling blocks increase.
